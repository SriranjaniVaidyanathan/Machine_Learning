    "This assignment is about how the Data is collected, read, preprocessed and visualizied. This is done using tools like Python, numpy, matplotlib, pandas,seaborn and Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data source from which the data was collected is Kaggle(\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets\"). I have chosen two dataset one for classification which contains data that describes 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results. The second data set used for regression contains data that describes daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various steps to visualize the dataset used for classification and regression. Below steps are done to visualize the data set. \n",
    "1. Read the data.\n",
    "2. Preprocessing the data.\n",
    "3. Visualize the data. \n"
